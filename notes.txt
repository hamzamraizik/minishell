// check heredoc and append symbol in tokenizing

//in first syntax check , chack the quotes correctly.


{<, >, >>, <<} every symbol in this list must be a word after it.

$? should be in deff tokenizing

test this in IMAC:
    write a prompt: ls | hello >> ls | ls

malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
Aborted (core dumped)


$"" : in this case the '$' must skiped // FIXED
if the node before var $.. , is heredoc type so not expand it, // FIXED 

this case should handled :
/*
echo $-
OUT -> himBHs *
/


/*
$!   -> empty string
$#   --> '0'
~ when in the token just the symbol '~' and nothing else will expended
and when there is '~\' will expended and join all before or after it.
