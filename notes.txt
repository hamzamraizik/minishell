// check heredoc and append symbol in tokenizing

//in first syntax check , chack the quotes correctly.


{<, >, >>, <<} every symbol in this list must be a word after it.

$? should be in deff tokenizing

test this in IMAC:
    write a prompt: ls | hello >> ls | ls

malloc(): invalid size (unsorted)
Aborted (core dumped)


$"" : in this case the '$' must skiped
if the node before var $.. , is heredoc type so not expand it, 

this case should handled :
/*
echo $-
OUT -> himBHs *
/
